Codes for Machine Learning course Assignments.



## Assignment 1

- Problem Statement:
  - Find cluster center (k=2 to 10) using K-Means clustering for every project. 
  - Compute the value of DB index and silhouette value 
  - Find the optimal number of cluster using DB index and silhouette value. 
  - Store your results with single excel file with multiple rows i.e., one row for each project 

- Software used: MATLAB



## Assignment 2

- Problem Statement:
  - Apply 3 different Naive Bayes Classifiers on all data. 
  - Apply 5-fold cross validation
  - Compute the value of F-measure and accuracy for all features and significant features
  - Find the best Naive Bayes Classifier and also compare original data with significant features data.
  - Store your results with single excel file with multiple rows i.e., one row for each project
- Programming language: Python
- Libraries used: numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib 



## Assignment 3

- Problem Statement:

  - Apply feature ranking techniques using gini split, information gain, PCA.
  - Apply same 3 different Naive Bayes Classifiers on selected features data.
  - Compute the value of F-measure and accuracy
  - Find the best Naive Bayes Classifier and also compare best sets of features.
  - Store your results with single excel file with multiple rows i.e., one row for each project

- Programming language: Python

- Libraries used: numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, graphviz

  

## Assignment 4

- Problem Statement:
  - Apply different data sampling techniques like random sampling, upsampling, and Downsampling to handle class imbalance problem.
  - Apply logistic regression, Decision tree on selected data.
  - Compute the value of F-measure and accuracy and find the best techniques.
  - Store your results with single excel file with multiple rows i.e., one row for each project 
  - You should also validated the null hypothesis like "There is no any significant improvement after applying data sampling techniques"
- Programming language: Python
- Libraries used: numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, graphviz
